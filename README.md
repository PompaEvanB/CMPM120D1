# Assignment 1 for CMPM 120 2023
## 3+ distinct visual scenes (with distinct “Scene” classes)
'Scene1', 'Scene2', and 'Scene3' are visually distinct from one another. Additionally the 'Loading' and 'End' scenes are also distinct.
## 2+ audio assets (e.g. background music and a sound effect)
One audio file is played in the 'Loading' scene, and another is played at the start of 'Scene1'. I made these files on BeepBox.com by myself.
## 2+ image assets (one with transparent background)
The hills in scenes 1-3, the cloud in scene2 have transparent background. All of the sky backgrounds are imported aswell and can be found in the 'assets' folder.
## 2+ geometric shapes (rendered in-engine)
The two geometric shapes I rendered in Phaser are both ellipses, one in 'Scene1' and another in 'Scene3'.
## 1+ big fancy text (composed out of engine)
The big fancy text I made is in the end scene. the text says "Painting Clouds" and is the title text for the "game". I rendered it in "Fire Alpaca".
## 1+ multi-line text (rendered in-engine)
There are two instances of multi-line text in this assignment. the text in "Scene1" and the text in the "End" scene. Both of these were rendered in engine.
## 1+ fading scene transition (e.g. fade to black)
The transition from "Scene3" to the "End" scene fades to and from black. There is a glitch due to the background image, but Im out of time :/
## 1+ object motion animation (e.g. sliding in from the side)
"Scene1","Scene2", and the "End" scene all have moving objects. "Scene1" and "Scene2" both have moving clouds, and the "End" scene has the moving title text.
